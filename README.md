What if programming languages were Hogwarts Houses?

Just a fun way to practice and I haven't found anything like that anywhere. "What if programming languages were..." : There's about superheroes, people, food,
characters of Game of Thrones, so I thought I should do something like that for the Hogwarts Houses. You can do it in order to randomly choose your house but I actually thought about
the traits of the houses and some characteristics of x programming language.
